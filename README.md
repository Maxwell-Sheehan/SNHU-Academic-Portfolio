Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room was a client who wished to design a live service game on multiple platforms. This ties into a large portion of the software requriement as the software had to be very scallable, and also
easily ported into different OS and mobile devices. The goal of the software design was to create a fun, responsive, live 'buzzer' game that features multiple contestants competing at the same time against the same information.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
One of my strengths in my documentation was describing the advantages and disadvantages of different OS design choices. I explained how given certain design wishes, or budget constraints I would choose a particular language.
This train of thought of what language should be used where I think will really help the client pick the best OS for their game.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The document helped me encapsalute my ideas fully, this is a big principle of OOP so I think it should be the same  for a desing document. Elaborating on my ideas for each OS was much easier given 
the template, seperating each aspect of design for you. This makes the client referencing desing details much sharper and seperated.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would try to further develop my knowledge of porting games to different services, including different languages and mobile devices. While I researched the tools and was able to talk about them,
I hadn't extensivly used them or really understand them in a programming compacity. At least with cloud based servers or physical servers I have experience with data and database management but API's syncrhonizing updates
is not something I've used in my scoop of work.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Interpreting their needs I talked about the better design choices depending on different budget levels and developer levels. Clinet's might already have a staffed team of devs, or a budget they have to stick too, so planning around this as a designing team is an important aspect.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I did my best to adhear to OOP, this was something I had in the back of my mind for all sections of design. You can see this reflected when I talk about live vs cloud based servers and the advntages of each.
I think almost any client plans to be succesful and thus wants to be scalable in their services, I would keep this idea and strategy in all future design processes. You would never want a client to succeed but fail to meet the consumer desiers for your services, then as a developer team have to completly revamp your software to be scalable. This would be detrimental for your reputation, and probably loose you clients.
